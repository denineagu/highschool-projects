# highschool-projects - General

The projects presented in here are representative for my knowledge in the field of Computing Science. I created separate branches for separate projects to facilitate their viewing. In the following paragraphs I decided to briefly summarize my history with different programming languages.

**Python** is the second programming language that I've learned (after C++). I took a private course, outside school, when I was around 13-14 and I instantly fell in love with it's simplicity and wide range of applications, especially when it comes to media-related projects. The "Carrot hunt" / "Duracell" project is a fun and age-appropriate representation of my knowledge in this branch.

**Web Development** (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP and MySQL) is my chosen field for the final Professional Certificate Exam that I recently took. The "Fiordilatte" project is an amazing combination of those 5 branches, thus summarizing my knowledge and work from the past years.

**C++** Is the main programming language in which I have the most experience. Although there's no significant project that I can upload here (only smaller tasks that I had to fulfill over the years), my chosen subject in the Romanian Baccalaureate exam was Computing Science (meaning C++ only), which I passed with a final grade of 9.8/10, thus stating my knowledge in this area as well.
