# highschool-projects - "Firodilatte"

The "fiordilatte" website was created during my last highschool year (12th grade) for the Project part of the Professional Certificate, a mandatory section of the Romanian Baccalaureat Exam.

The Certificate of Professional Skills in Computer Science (the exam that I took due to the Mathematics - Computer Science field of study that I chose as my Highschool specialisation) consists of two parts, both of which I successfully passed with an overall grade of 10/10: a Practical Test (C++, MySQL and Microsoft Word) and a Project (this website, in my case).

Thus, the website attached in this section resembles my work for the aforementioned National Exam. It combines elements of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP and MySQL and summarizes the knowledge I gained in this branch during my 4 years of Intensive Computer Science courses in highschool.

I also attached the documentation for this project, where all the background information and explanations can be found.
