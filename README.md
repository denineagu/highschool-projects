# highschool-projects - "Carrot hunt"

The "Carrot hunt" / "Duracell" game is my first Python project ever: I started it when I was 13 and finished it in Highschool.

The rules are quite simple - the game works like the famous "Snake" : the player's character is the Duracell Rabbit which feeds on randomly placed carrots and is controlled through the arrows on the keyboard (hence the name "Carrot hunt"). After a certain amount of carrots is collected, the "food" turns into a battery, making both the rabbit's speed and the level of dificulty increase. The game is over when the player touches the edge of the window. The purpose is to collect as many carrots / batteries as possible, before the game is over.

For a better visual representation, I attached here a photo of the game whilst being run on my computer.
